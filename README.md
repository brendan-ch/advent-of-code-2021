# Project setup
First, install Python 3 on your system if you haven't already.

Create a `inputFiles` directory in the root folder of the project. Label input files with `day` followed by the day number and the `.txt` extension. (e.g. `day1.txt`, `day2.txt`, and so on). Paste your puzzle input for each day into these files.

Run the code for each day with `python day#.py`. Each file includes code for both parts.
